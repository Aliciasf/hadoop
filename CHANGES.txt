Hadoop Change Log


Trunk (unreleased)

 1. Fix HADOOP-126. 'bin/hadoop dfs -cp' now correctly copies .crc
    files.  (Konstantin Shvachko via cutting)

 2. Fix HADOOP-51. Change DFS to support per-file replication counts.
    (Konstantin Shvachko via cutting)

 3. Fix HADOOP-131.  Add scripts to start/stop dfs and mapred daemons.
    Use these in start/stop-all scripts.  (Chris Mattmann via cutting)

 4. Stop using ssh options by default that are not yet in widely used
    versions of ssh.  Folks can still enable their use by uncommenting
    a line in conf/hadoop-env.sh. (cutting)

 5. Fix HADOOP-92.  Show information about all attempts to run each
    task in the web ui.  (Mahadev konar via cutting)

 6. Fix HADOOP-128.  Improved DFS error handling. (Owen O'Malley via cutting)

 7. Fix HADOOP-129.  Replace uses of java.io.File with new class named
    Path.  This fixes bugs where java.io.File methods were called
    directly when FileSystem methods were desired, and reduces the
    likelihood of such bugs in the future.  It also makes the handling
    of pathnames more consistent between local and dfs FileSystems and
    between Windows and Unix. java.io.File-based methods are still
    available for back-compatibility, but are deprecated and will be
    removed once 0.2 is released. (cutting)

 8. Change dfs.data.dir and mapred.local.dir to be comma-separated
    lists of directories, no longer be space-separated. This fixes
    several bugs on Windows. (cutting)


Release 0.1.1 - 2006-04-08

 1. Added CHANGES.txt, logging all significant changes to Hadoop.  (cutting)

 2. Fix MapReduceBase.close() to throw IOException, as declared in the
    Closeable interface.  This permits subclasses which override this
    method to throw that exception. (cutting)

 3. Fix HADOOP-117.  Pathnames were mistakenly transposed in
    JobConf.getLocalFile() causing many mapred temporary files to not
    be removed.  (Raghavendra Prabhu via cutting)
 
 4. Fix HADOOP-116. Clean up job submission files when jobs complete.
    (cutting)

 5. Fix HADOOP-125. Fix handling of absolute paths on Windows (cutting)

Release 0.1.0 - 2006-04-01

 1. The first release of Hadoop.
