        <title>29 October 2007: release 0.15.0 available </title>
	<p>This release contains my improvements, new features, bug
        fixes and optimizations.</p>
	<p>Notably, this contains the first working version of <a
	href="http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-hadoop/Hbase">HBase</a>.</p>
        <p>See the release notes (above) for details.</p>

	<note>When upgrading an existing HDFS filesystem to a 0.15.x
	release from an earlier release, you should first start HDFS
	with 'bin/start-dfs.sh -upgrade'.  See the <a
	href="http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-hadoop/Hadoop_Upgrade">Hadoop
	Upgrade</a> page for details.</note>

        <title>19 October, 2007: release 0.14.3 available </title>
	<p>This release fixes critical bugs in release 0.14.2.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title> 4 September, 2007: release 0.14.1 available </title>
	<p>New features in release 0.14 include:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>Better checksums in HDFS.  Checksums are no longer
	  stored in parallel HDFS files, but are stored directly by
	  datanodes alongside blocks.  This is more efficient for the
	  namenode and also improves data integrity.</li>

	  <li>Pipes: A C++ API for MapReduce</li>

	  <li>Eclipse Plugin, including HDFS browsing, job
	  monitoring, etc.</li>

	  <li>File modification times in HDFS.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>There are many other improvements, bug fixes, optimizations
	and new features.  Performance and reliability are better than
	ever.</p>

	<note>When upgrading an existing HDFS filesystem to a 0.14.x
	release from a 0.13.x or earlier release, you should first
	start HDFS with 'bin/start-dfs.sh -upgrade'.  See the <a
	href="http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-hadoop/Hadoop_0.14_Upgrade">Hadoop
	0.14 Upgrade</a> page for details.</note>
