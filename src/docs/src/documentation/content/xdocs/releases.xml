        <title> 9 October, 2007: release 0.14.2 available </title>
	<p>This release fixes critical bugs in release 0.14.1.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title> 4 September, 2007: release 0.14.1 available </title>
	<p>New features in release 0.14 include:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>Better checksums in HDFS.  Checksums are no longer
	  stored in parallel HDFS files, but are stored directly by
	  datanodes alongside blocks.  This is more efficient for the
	  namenode and also improves data integrity.</li>

	  <li>Pipes: A C++ API for MapReduce</li>

	  <li>Eclipse Plugin, including HDFS browsing, job
	  monitoring, etc.</li>

	  <li>File modification times in HDFS.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>There are many other improvements, bug fixes, optimizations
	and new features.  Performance and reliability are better than
	ever.</p>

	<note>When upgrading an existing HDFS filesystem to this
	release, you should first start HDFS with 'bin/start-dfs.sh
	-upgrade'.  See the <a
	href="http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-hadoop/Hadoop_0.14_Upgrade">Hadoop
	0.14 Upgrade</a> page for details.</note>

        performance and reliability improvements.  For example,
        MapReduce sort performance on large clusters has <a
